### **Day 1: Planning & Setup**

Day one is crucial as it lays the foundation for your project. This phase involves defining your project’s scope, designing the user interface, and setting up the development environment. Here’s a deeper dive into what you should focus on:

#### **1.1 Define Project Scope**

**Objective:** Clearly understand what you’re building, what features it will have, and how users will interact with it.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify Core Features:**
   - **Homepage:** Displays recent match results and provides navigation to other sections.
   - **Add Results Page:** Allows users to input the outcomes of their matches.
   - **Statistics Page:** Shows detailed player statistics, such as total matches, wins, losses, and average scores.
   - **League Table Page:** Ranks players based on their performance, displaying standings and other relevant data.

2. **Create User Stories:**
   - **As a user,** I want to see the most recent match results on the homepage, so I can quickly check the latest outcomes.
   - **As a user,** I want to add my match results, so my performance can be tracked.
   - **As a user,** I want to view my and my friend’s statistics, so I can analyze our performance.
   - **As a user,** I want to see the league table, so I can compare my ranking with others.

3. **Define Functional Requirements:**
   - The application should allow users to input and submit match results.
   - It should automatically update player statistics based on the submitted results.
   - The league table should dynamically reflect the latest standings.

4. **Outline Non-functional Requirements:**
   - **Performance:** The app should load quickly and handle multiple data inputs smoothly.
   - **Usability:** The UI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
   - **Security:** Ensure data is stored securely, especially when deployed.

#### **1.2 Design Mockups**

**Objective:** Visualize the layout and design of each page before you start coding. This helps in creating a cohesive user experience.

**Steps:**

1. **Sketch Wireframes:**
   - **Homepage:** Plan where to place the recent matches section, navigation menu, and any introductory text.
   - **Add Results Page:** Design a simple, user-friendly form layout where users can input match details.
   - **Statistics Page:** Consider how to display player stats clearly, possibly using tables or charts.
   - **League Table Page:** Decide on the best way to present the rankings, with a focus on clarity and ease of comparison.

2. **Choose a Design Tool:**
   - Tools like **Figma**, **Adobe XD**, or **Sketch** can help you create more detailed and interactive mockups.
   - These tools allow you to experiment with color schemes, typography, and spacing.

3. **Design Consistency:**
   - Ensure that all pages follow a consistent design language, including similar button styles, font choices, and color palettes.

4. **Consider User Flow:**
   - Map out how users will navigate from one page to another. For instance, after submitting match results, users might be redirected to the statistics page to see updated data.

5. **Design for Responsiveness:**
   - Think about how your design will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring it’s mobile-friendly.

#### **1.3 Set Up Development Environment**

**Objective:** Establish a clean and organized environment for coding, ensuring you have all the tools and dependencies needed for smooth development.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize Version Control:**
   - Set up a Git repository (use GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to track your progress and collaborate if needed.
   - Create branches for different features (e.g., `feature/homepage`, `feature/add-results`).

2. **Create Project Structure:**
   - **Frontend:** Initialize a React project using `Create React App` or `Vite`. This sets up your development environment with React, Webpack, and other essential tools.
     - Example folder structure:
       ```
       /src
       ├── /components
       ├── /pages
       ├── App.js
       ├── index.js
       └── /assets
       ```
   - **Backend:** Set up an Express.js project. You can use the `express-generator` for a quick start or manually configure it with essential middlewares like `body-parser`, `cors`, etc.
     - Example folder structure:
       ```
       /server
       ├── /controllers
       ├── /models
       ├── /routes
       ├── app.js
       └── server.js
       ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - **Frontend:** Install necessary packages like React Router for navigation, Axios for API calls, and any UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Tailwind CSS).
     - Example:
       ```bash
       npm install react-router-dom axios
       ```
   - **Backend:** Install Express, Nodemon (for auto-reloading during development), and any database libraries you plan to use (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB, Sequelize for SQL).
     - Example:
       ```bash
       npm install express nodemon mongoose
       ```

4. **Setup Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in your backend to store sensitive data like database connection strings and API keys.
   - Example:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/fifa
     PORT=5000
     ```

5. **Basic Configuration:**
   - **Frontend:** Set up routing using React Router, and create placeholder components for each page.
   - **Backend:** Set up basic routes and controllers, and test with a simple API endpoint (`/api/test`).

6. **Connect Frontend and Backend:**
   - Set up a proxy in your React app to forward API requests to your Express server during development.
   - Example in `package.json`:
     ```json
     "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
     ```

7. **Test Initial Setup:**
   - Run both the React and Express servers to ensure everything is configured correctly.
   - Verify that you can make API calls from the React frontend to the Express backend.

### **Outcome of Day 1:**

By the end of Day 1, you should have a clear understanding of what your project will entail and how it will look. Your design mockups should provide a visual guide, and your development environment should be fully set up, allowing you to dive into coding on Day 2. This preparation ensures that you can work efficiently in the following days, minimizing the risk of encountering major roadblocks.

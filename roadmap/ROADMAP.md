If you have one week to work on your FIFA results tracking project, you'll need a focused and efficient plan to cover key aspects of both frontend and backend development. Here’s a streamlined roadmap to help you achieve significant progress within a week:

### **Day 1: Planning & Setup**

**1.1 Define Project Scope**
- Clarify the features you need: homepage, add results page, statistics page, and league table page.
- Write down key functionalities and user stories.

**1.2 Design Mockups**
- Sketch basic wireframes or use a design tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD) to create mockups for each page.
- Decide on the layout, color scheme, and overall look.

**1.3 Set Up Development Environment**
- Initialize your project repositories (GitHub/GitLab).
- Set up your development environment for React and Express.js.

### **Day 2: Frontend - Homepage & Add Results Page**

**2.1 Initialize React Project**
- Create a new React project using Create React App or a similar tool.

**2.2 Develop Homepage**
- Create the `Homepage` component.
- Implement sections for recent match results and navigation links.
- Basic styling for the homepage.

**2.3 Develop Add Results Page**
- Create the `AddResults` component.
- Build the form for inputting match results (player names, scores, date).
- Implement form submission and basic validation.
- Basic styling for the form.

### **Day 3: Frontend - Statistics Page & League Table Page**

**3.1 Develop Statistics Page**
- Create the `Statistics` component.
- Implement functionality to fetch and display player statistics.
- Add simple charts or visualizations (optional).

**3.2 Develop League Table Page**
- Create the `LeagueTable` component.
- Implement functionality to fetch and display league standings.
- Basic styling for the table.

### **Day 4: Backend - Setup & API Endpoints**

**4.1 Initialize Express Project**
- Set up a new Express.js project.

**4.2 Create API Endpoints**
- **`GET /recent-matches`:** Fetch recent match results.
- **`POST /add-result`:** Submit new match results.
- **`GET /statistics`:** Retrieve player statistics.
- **`GET /league-table`:** Retrieve league standings.

**4.3 Implement Controllers**
- Create controllers for handling match results and statistics.

### **Day 5: Backend - Database & Integration**

**5.1 Set Up Database**
- Choose a database and set up schemas for storing match results and statistics.

**5.2 Implement Database Integration**
- Connect your Express.js application to the database.
- Implement CRUD operations for managing match results and player statistics.

**5.3 Connect Frontend to Backend**
- Implement API calls in React to interact with your backend endpoints.

### **Day 6: Testing & Refinements**

**6.1 Test Functionality**
- Test frontend components and backend endpoints to ensure they work correctly.
- Check form submissions, data retrieval, and page rendering.

**6.2 Perform User Testing**
- Conduct basic usability testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

### **Day 7: Deployment & Documentation**

**7.1 Prepare for Deployment**
- Build the React application for production.
- Configure Express.js for production deployment.

**7.2 Deploy Frontend**
- Deploy your React application to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

**7.3 Deploy Backend**
- Deploy your Express.js backend to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

**7.4 Documentation**
- Write basic documentation for your codebase and user instructions.
- Ensure that the documentation is clear and concise.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Time Management:** Stick to the schedule and avoid spending too much time on any single task.
- **Focus on Core Features:** Prioritize the essential features that will make your project functional.
- **Iterate Quickly:** Build, test, and refine iteratively to ensure you’re making steady progress.

By following this one-week roadmap, you should be able to set up the core functionality of your FIFA results tracking project and have a working prototype ready for further refinement and deployment.
